// *OUTPUT* 
// The output for each rover should be its final co-ordinates and the direction.

// i.e. The rover's current coordinates are (0, 4) and it is facing S

// The above state could be achieved by the following sequence: 

// Input: M
// Output: The rover's current coordinates are (0, 1) and it is facing N
// Input: M
// Output: The rover's current coordinates are (0, 2) and it is facing N
// Input: M
// Output: The rover's current coordinates are (0, 3) and it is facing N
// Input: M
// Output: The rover's current coordinates are (0, 4) and it is facing N
// Input: L
// Output: The rover's current coordinates are (0, 4) and it is facing W
// Input: L
// Output: The rover's current coordinates are (0, 4) and it is facing S


// Challenge:

// Note: It would be helpful to read and understand each of these before starting.
// You’re welcomed to use an Object-Oriented approach or a Functional one.

// 1. Design a class or object to describe the Rover.
// 2. Add methods or functions to support the command to move, and the command to change direction.
// 3. Return the result, formatted as per the above 

// Hint: “There are stretch goals which will highlight boundaries to the space, adding additional rovers, or adding boulders in a couple grid locations”. 

// With limited time, there’s no rush to finish the challenge or get to the stretch goals. But if there’s time we will have some fun with it.
